This is repositiry with my tasks solutions at Codewars.com which have been solved by using C++.

List of most interesting tasks:

| Kata name                            | Goal                               | Solved by                          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------    | ---------------------------------- |
| 1kyu_77_Skyscrapers                  | Exact cover problem                | AlgorithmX with tree pruning (DLX) |
| 1kyu_Square_sums                     | Hamilton path problem              | Greedy search with Warnsdorff rule |
| 1kyu_Sliding_Puzzle_Solver           | Large-Scale Sliding puzzle(10x10)  | DSolving (State Transition Table)  |
| 4kyu_Sudoku_Solution_Validator       | 9x9 sudoku puzzle                  | Classic AlgorithmX                 |
| Will be added                        | Stohastic optimization             | Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)      |
| Will be added                        | Stohastic optimization             | Simulated Anneling (SA)            |

At Codewars.com code have to passed all test withing 12 second time limit without any compiller flags optimizations like -02/-03.
